# üìò My SoftUni Python Tasks

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python exercises from my time at SoftUni! Each task covers a different concept in programming, and I‚Äôve added clear descriptions below to help you understand what each script does. Perfect for learners! üòä

**Filename:** `fruit_price_by_day.py`

* Asks for fruit name, day of the week, and quantity.

* Calculates the price based on whether it‚Äôs a weekday or weekend.

* Prints "error" if the fruit or day is not valid.

**Concepts used: lists, nested conditions, input validation

- [link to code](https://github.com/Daniel-Gamov/SofUni_tasks_and_progects/blob/main/SofUni_Codes/fruit_price_by_day.py)

## üìö 9. Find Your Favorite Book
**Filename:** `find_book.py`

* Asks the user for the title of their favorite book.

* Continuously reads book titles until it matches the favorite one or "No More Books" is entered.

* If the book is found, it prints how many books were checked before finding it.

* If not found, it prints that the book wasn‚Äôt found and how many were checked.

* Concepts used: input, while loop, conditional statements, break

- [link to code](https://github.com/Daniel-Gamov/SofUni_tasks_and_progects/blob/main/SofUni_Codes/find_book.py)

## üß† 10. Exam Results Tracker
**Filename:** `exam_tracker.py`

* Tracks problems and grades until the user enters "Enough" or reaches a certain number of poor grades (‚â§ 4).

* Calculates the average score and prints the last problem before stopping.

* If too many poor grades are given, it tells the user they need a break.

* Concepts used: input, float, while loop, counters, averaging, conditional logic

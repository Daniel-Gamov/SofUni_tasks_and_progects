# üìò My SoftUni Python Tasks

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python exercises from my time at SoftUni! Each task covers a different concept in programming, and I‚Äôve added clear descriptions below to help you understand what each script does. Perfect for learners! üòä

## üéÅ 3. Bonus Points Calculator

**Filename:** `bonus_points.py`

* Based on input points:

  * ‚â§100 ‚Üí +5 bonus points
  * > 100 and ‚â§1000 ‚Üí +20% of points
  * > 1000 ‚Üí +10% of points
* Adds extra points if number is even or ends in 5.
* Prints bonus points and total score.

**Concepts used:** if-else, modulus, percentage logic, math operations

## üèôÔ∏è 5. City Price Calculator
**Filename:** `city_product_price.py`

* Asks for product name, city, and quantity.

* Calculates the total price based on the city-specific product prices.

* Each city (Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna) has different pricing.

**Concepts used:** conditional statements, nested if, basic arithmetic

## üïì 6. Shop Open Hours Checker
**Filename:** `shop_open_checker.py`

* Takes input for hour and day of the week.

* Checks if the shop is open (between 10:00‚Äì18:00 and on weekdays).

* Outputs "open" or "closed" depending on the time.

**Concepts used: `list membership, range()`, conditional logic

## üçç 7. Fruit Price by Day
**Filename:** `fruit_price_by_day.py`

* Asks for fruit name, day of the week, and quantity.

* Calculates the price based on whether it‚Äôs a weekday or weekend.

* Prints "error" if the fruit or day is not valid.

**Concepts used: lists, nested conditions, input validation

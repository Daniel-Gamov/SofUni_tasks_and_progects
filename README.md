## 🧮 1. Calculate Discounted Price

**Filename:** `discount_calculator.py`

* Calculates total price based on quantity.
* Applies an 18% discount.
* Prints the final price and amount saved.

**Concepts used:** input, float, arithmetic, formatted strings

* (The Code)[https://github.com/Daniel-Gamov/SofUni_tasks_and_progects/blob/main/SofUni_Codes/discount_calcolator.py]

## ✏️ 2. School Supplies Cost with Discount

**Filename:** `school_supplies.py`

* Asks for number of pens, markers, and cleaning solution in liters.
* Calculates total price.
* Applies user-specified discount percentage.
* Prints the discounted total.

**Concepts used:** input, float, percentages, multi-step calculations

## 🎁 3. Bonus Points Calculator

**Filename:** `bonus_points.py`

* Based on input points:

  * ≤100 → +5 bonus points
  * > 100 and ≤1000 → +20% of points
  * > 1000 → +10% of points
* Adds extra points if number is even or ends in 5.
* Prints bonus points and total score.

**Concepts used:** if-else, modulus, percentage logic, math operations



---

## 🎬 4. Can You Watch the Episode?

**Filename:** `tv_episode_break.py`

* Asks for TV show name, episode duration, and total break time.
* Calculates time spent eating and relaxing.
* Determines if you have enough time left to watch the episode.
* Gives a nice message depending on the result.

**Concepts used:** division, conditional logic, `math.ceil()`



---

## 🏙️ 5. City Price Calculator
**Filename:** `city_product_price.py`

* Asks for product name, city, and quantity.

* Calculates the total price based on the city-specific product prices.

* Each city (Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna) has different pricing.

**Concepts used:** conditional statements, nested if, basic arithmetic



---

## 🕓 6. Shop Open Hours Checker
**Filename:** `shop_open_checker.py`

* Takes input for hour and day of the week.

* Checks if the shop is open (between 10:00–18:00 and on weekdays).

* Outputs "open" or "closed" depending on the time.

**Concepts used: `list membership, range()`, conditional logic




---

## 🍍 7. Fruit Price by Day
**Filename:** `fruit_price_by_day.py`

* Asks for fruit name, day of the week, and quantity.
